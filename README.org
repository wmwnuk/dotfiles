#+title: My dotfiles

The dotfiles can be 'installed' using GNU stow:

#+begin_src sh
stow ~/Projects/dotfiles/ -t ~ module
#+end_src

'theme-files' shouldn't be stowed, there's 'install-themes.sh' script.

Also including the themes here seems a little clumsy, but it's also the easiest
way to set up everything quickly on a fresh system.
